\title{OpenTTDLab: A framework for repeatable, Replicable, \& Reproducible experiments using OpenTTD}

\author{Michal Charemza}

\date{\today}

\abstract{
OpenTTD is an open source business simulation game based on the 1994 game Transport Tycoon Deluxe, and in spite of being designed for recreation, OpenTTD has been used in a number of academic studies. However, these studies have problems regarding the repeatability, replicability, \& reproducibility of their experiments. In this dissertation, I present OpenTTDLab, a framework I created that allows OpenTTD to be used in a way that avoids these problems. I then show proof-of-concept results using this framework that I argue are repeatable, replicable, and reproducible; thus, giving evidence that OpenTTDLab can be a useful tool in future research.

Firstly thank you to Chris Sawyer, the original author of Transport Tycoon Deluxe: without you this project would not have existed. Then of course thank you to all the contributors of OpenTTLab over its 20 year history. And of these, thank you especially to Patric Stout (A.K.A. Truebrain), who not only gave advice and what I interpreted to be light blessing to this project, but also wrote the OpenTTD save game parser that OpenTTDLab originally forked from.

Thank you also to Ian Earle (A.K.A. BasicBeluga) who found an issue in the documentation of OpenTTDLab and submitted a fix for it. While this was a small change, I took it as evidence that what I was creating stood a chance of being useful, and pushed me to continue.

Thank you to my supervisor Michael Hermann. His ongoing advice throughout this project has been invaluable, and I think also pushed me to do as good a job as I can, including making sure that I have some results to show and discuss, and didn't get too lost in just making OpenTTDLab.

Of course thank you to my husband Matthew Beach, whose support and advice was extremely helpful, and that I cannot imagine living without. And finally, thank you to our dog, Elliot: he's a good boy.

\chapter{Introduction}

OpenTTD \cite{openttd} is an open source real time strategy (RTS) simulation game based on the 1994 game Transport Tycoon Deluxe by Chris Sawyer. The aim of the game is to successfully run a business by constructing networks of roads, railways, airports and ports, along with their respective vehicles, trains, planes and ships, in order to transport people and goods in exchange for money. OpenTTD is played on a simulated landscape as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:openttd}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\label{fig:openttd}
\end{figure}


OpenTTD was created as a game for recreation. However, it is remarkably flexible: it has been successfully used as a tool to research artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms \cite{wisniewski2011artificial, rios2009trains, bijlsma2014evolving}, scalability and mobile applications \cite{jiang2018mirroring}, and as a teaching aid \cite{HansenMuprhie2018}. It allows a single player to play in a non competitive world building mode, multiple human players playing cooperatively or competitively, and allows so-called custom AI-players that each control a company via code not part of the OpenTTD, but part of extensions to it written in the Squirrel language.

Using OpenTTD as a tool for research is the focus of this project, and specifically the focus is the development of a tool that augments its existing features for repeatable, replicable, \& reproducible research.

\section{A brief history of learning from simulation games}

Games have a long history of being used as tools beyond recreation, and specifically as tools to simulate the real world in order to take conclusions about the game environment and apply them to the world outside of the game, with war games doing this as far back even to ancient periods \cite{mayer2009gaming}. One of the world's oldest board game, Go (the `game of encircling territories' to literally translate its Mandarin name), originating in China approximately 4000 years ago and popular since, has been argued to embody strategies that bear a striking resemblance to Chinese strategies of war and diplomacy, and these arguments have been paired with suggestions that Americans could better understand current (as of 2004) real-world Chinese strategies by learning Go \cite{lai2004learning}. Go is played on a grid, much like OpenTTD, suggesting also that OpenTTD's discretized simplification of space also has a long history in simulation.

The military-style/war games eventually evolved to logistic simulations, albeit still in military context. Fore example based MONOPOLOGS \cite{jackson1959learning} that is often credited as the first computerised logistics simulation game - SAY WHEN AND WHAT USED FOR. Then the MIT beer game - to illustrate something in supply chains. These then evolved to games that informed policy making - EXAMPLE.


This evolved [REF]

----

OpenTTD is part of a wider class of games: simulation games. Simulation games have been frequently used in various fields to explore scenarios in an effort to inform policies. PUT IN LIST.

Attention is usually paid to how realistic these games are. For example, \cite{raghothama2013review} summarises how well a number of games, including OpenTTD, how well the games model the real world. It's worth noting that while the economic model of OpenTTD is not realistic, \cite{raghothama2013review} classes some aspects of the transportation model as realistic, albeit without justification.



\section{Repeatability, Replicatability, \& Reproducibility}



The terms repeatability, replicability, and reproducibility unfortunately do not historically have universally agreed meanings \cite{plesser_reproducibility_2018}. To add to the confusion, the ACM have swapped their definitions reproducibility and replicability \cite{association_for_computing_machiner_new_2020}. For the avoidance of doubt, I use the ACM's definitions that are current as of October 2023 \cite{association_for_computing_machiner_artifact_2020}. For some results of an experiment conducted by a team of authors, where some computer-based artefacts were created to conduct these, these can be summarised as

\begin{description}
\item[Repeatability] The authors can obtain the results again, using the same artefacts.
\item[Reproducibility] A different team can obtain the results, using the original authors' artefacts.
\item[Replicability] A different team can obtain the results, without using any of the original authors' artefacts.
\end{description}

The strongest of these these, replicability, does not require a full re-implementation of all artifacts used in the research, but only those created by the original team. In OpenTTD terms, if an author writes a custom AI that is used in experiments, only that AI would need to be implemented by another team to replicate the research. OpenTTD itself would not need to be re-implemented in order for experiments to satisfy the definition of replicability.

Beyond just supplying definitions, the ACM also provide a system of 5 badges, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:acm_badges}. These can be applied to published research to incentivise research authors to make it so their research is reproducible and replicable by other teams. Other similar systems of badges are available.

It is my hope that the framework presented here will make it more likely that research using OpenTTD will be not only repeatable, reproducible and replicable, but also more likely that upon publication, given all of these badges. 

\section{Barriers to Repeatability, Replicatability, \& Reproducibility}

\section{Review of research using OpenTTD}

Note - put this after the 3Rs stuff. The 3Rs stuff will have (especially for reproduciliby and replicability) barriers, and so I should be able to basically discuss the research, stating what barriers it seems to have.

\begin{itemize}
\begin{item}
Some papers list how they found all their upstream papers, in a light meta-analysis way. Worth it here? If I'm arguing something is lacking in particular, then maybe yes, because I sort of need evidence of an exhaustive search
\end{item}
\begin{item} Maybe this section could be split into using using OpenTTD in experiments, and just mentioning it
\end{item}
\begin{item}
\cite{fenjiro2018deep} - Mentions OpenTTD uses Deep Learning, but not partcular context or explanation. It doesn't really?? Do even any of the published AIs??
\end{item}
\end{itemize}

TODO: If we have the more structured / formal reproducibility stuff earlier, we can more properly judge the existing research.

From the found published research using OpenTTD, in my opinion there is yet to be a single case that couldn't offer significant improvements in at least one of its repeatability, replicability or replicability.

\subsection{Repeatability}

Repeatability should be the easiest of the 3Rs to achieve, especially with computer based simulation. However, much of the existing research using OpenTTD uses a low number of repeated experiments, with little or no statistical analysis, suggesting that it was not straightforward. The experiments of \cite{wisniewski2011artificial} were run just 3 times for example. The experiments in \cite{rios2009trains} were run 14 times, but not even for the same amount of in-game time.

\subsection{Reproducibility}

For reproducibility the author-supplied artifacts must be clear and available. There were references to modified OpenTTD in \cite{wisniewski2011artificial}, but the modified versions does not seem to be available. Potentially the authors could be contacted to supply their own artefacts, but this is not ideal, nor offers a strong guarantee that the artefacts supplied were exactly as they were that generated the results.

Also, the version of OpenTTD is not mentioned

The seeds of each experiements were also not supplied.

\subsection{Replicability}

This is the most difficult to judge without actually attempting to do it, and it is what.

However, if an experiemnt isn't even reproducible, it is even more difficult to replicate it.

\chapter{OpenTTD's behaviours and features of OpenTTD}

\section{Formalism/algorithm of the game}

\section{Review of OpenTTD command line options and configuration}
OpenTTD as of version 13.4 has over X command line options and Y configuration options that allow the player to customise how it behaves when playing. The ones that are particularly applicable to a  for repeatable, reproducible, and replicable research are reviewed below.

\subsection{Command line options}

\begin{description}
\item[-G \textless seed\textgreater] Allows the specification of the seed that initialises the random number generator that controls the pseudo random aspects of the game. For example, OpenTTD can auto generate landscapes. With the same seed (along with other configuration) one generation will be the same as the next
\item[-g] Starts a game immediately, rather than requiring the user to click through a introductory menu 
\item[-vnull:ticks=\textless number of ticks\textgreater] Puts the same into a "null" video mode that does not display the playing area on screen, and exits the game after a set number of \emph{ticks}. A tick is equal to approximately 1/Y of a day in game time.
\end{description}

The specification of the random seed should mean that OpenTTD affords exact repeatability and reproducibility when running as a simulation using only AI players. This means that it should be possible to make it straightfoward for to make results exactly reproducible, going beyond the requirements for ACM's badges on that front.

\subsection{Configuration options}

\begin{description}
\item[{fast\_forward\_speed\_limit} = \textless limit\textgreater] Limits the ticks per second the limit, which has a hard coded maximum in the game of 50000

\item[{[ai\_players]}] Allows the specification of which player are human and which are AI, and when they start playing.

\item[autosave = monthly|daily|other CHECK]

\item[keep\_all\_autosave]  A boolean value that allows all autosaves to be kept for further analysis
\end{description}


\section{The save game format}

OpenTTD saves its data in a custom binary format - its so-called savegame format. OpenTTD offers an extremely basic tool for extracting some data from this format. However, a separate Python based tool is available to extract data from save games

\section{What doesn't exist}

\begin{itemize}
\begin{item}
With reference to the the desired things from the reproducibility section, mention things that don't exist
\end{item}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{The framework}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering

\caption{The OpenTTDLab logo. I created this based on the existing GPLv2-licensed OpenTTDLogo, and it is displayed alongside the code of OpenTTDLab in its public documentation.}
\label{fig:openttlab-logo}
\end{figure}

As discussed in Chapter 1, repeatability is in the domain of the original researchers, while both replicability and reproducibility are in the domain of other researchers armed with the original results. Given the different aims and audiences, it's not immediate that a single tool can be used in all of these. However, the Python framework OpenTTDLab I created attempts to be useful in all of these: to augment the existing behaviour of OpenTTD of Chapter 2 to help address at least some of the barriers detailed in Chapter 1. This chapter details the design process I followed to create OpenTTDLab to do this, and the resulting internal behaviour and user-facing features of the framework.

\section{Design and creation process}

A lightweight and highly agile process was used to design and create OpenTTDLab, the high level features of which are shown figure \ref{fig:solo-agile}. After the problems to solve have were identified, as discussed in Chapter 1, there were many cycles of writing usage documentation for code, writing code, and using the code, either to construct the results of Chapter 4 or in tests; and each of these with tight cycles of evaluating the outputs of these activities and informally judging if the code does (or would if it existed) help produce research that was repeatable, replicable and reproducible. Each of these activities would inform each other in tight cycles.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{The process I followed designing and creating OpenTTDLab. After identifying the problems that I'm trying to address, I conducted cycles of documenting code (that may not have existed), writing the code, and using the code, all coupled with tight cycles of evaluating how it solved, or would solve, the problem of running experiments using OpenTTD that were repeatable, replicable and reproducible.}
\label{fig:solo-agile}
\end{figure}

I use the term lightweight in that there were no \emph{events} that are common to \emph{Scrum}-like processes \cite{SCRUM} (often known as \emph{ceremonies} from my own experience), and with one exception, no phases planned in advance as is prescribed, for example, for UK government services \cite{GOVUKAgile}. And I describe the process as highly agile because in some cases iterations would take literally seconds, especially when writing documentation.

This was in fact the one exception to not having phases planned in advance: I did plan to create an initial version of light usage documentation very early in the project. Taking inspiration from Tom Preseton Warner's Readme driven development \cite{ReadmeDrivenDevelopment} and Amazon's Working Backwards method \cite{bryar2021working}, both at the beginning and throughout the project I would usually write such documentation for code without the code first existing. This allowed me to imagine it being used, evaluate how well it would solve the problems I'm trying to solve, and change its design accordingly by quickly changing its documentation. Of course, documentation for code that does not exist has very little value, so I moved quickly to writing and using code, mostly informed by "Working software is the primary measure of progress" and "Deliver working software frequently" from the Agile Manifesto \cite{beck2001manifesto}, which I judge to be the most useful parts of the Agile Manifesto, especially when working alone (albeit with advice from others) when the other parts are less applicable - they focus on communication between different people involved in project.

I did not attempt to keep a precise record of the cycles. However, as a guide, the GitHub repository that stores the history of code changes can be used. I created 52 releases, which I labelled v0.0.1 through v0.0.52, 150 pull requests (PRs), and over 350 commits in the repository, and each of these I evaluated against problems and desired properties of Chapter 1, and then carried on with more of the same activity, or another activity of Figure \ref{fig:solo-agile}.

The first version, v0.0.1, was the result of a fork from Patric Stout's \emph{OpenTTD-savegame-reader} \cite{Stout2024}, an existing project that extracts data from OpenTTD save game files - files that save the state of play in OpenTTD that allows players to exit but resume at the same point later. This could be used when using OpenTTD to run simulations, albeit in a time consuming way because the manual steps involved.

Then, but still from very early in the process, v0.0.3, I created and maintained a small suite of tests for OpenTTDLab, asserting on its high level behaviour. The tests were not just for asserting on the behaviour of the code, they were also a special case of "Use code" in the design process: they allowed me to extremely quickly gauge the suitability of the design of the OpenTTDLab, because to write test tests I had to use OpenTTDLab in a way very similar to those that experimenters would have to use it.

This leads to the main downside of this process. While the process allowed a high number of cycles of evaluations, all feedback and evaluation is from myself, from either running the code or, even worse, just imagining running the code. Being the designer I know it extremely well and so am ill-placed to evaluate what amounts to its ease of use for people that don't know it as well: I'm essentially \emph{marking my own homework}, and in some cases before it was even written. User research was not included in the process in order to limit the scope of the project, and to allow as many iterations as possible within the available time, which includes using the framework to produce the results of Chapter 4.

The other downside is that the process optimizes for the specific usage I chose, which as will be seen in Chapter 4, are repeating experiments, rather than reproducing or replicating them. However, as discussed in Chapter 1, repeating experiments is part of reproducing and replicating them, and so focusing on repeating experiments is a suitable way of limiting the scope of the project while still producing behaviour that should be a useful component when reproducing or replicating them.


\section{High level architecture}

Through the design and creation process, particularly after evaluation, I made a number of high level architectural decisions: the use of Python, behaving identically where possible on different platforms, automatically downloading OpenTTD and OpenGFX, supporting both AIs in the local filesystem, and automatically downloading AIs, caching, and the use of parallelisation.

I chose Python as the main language for both the internals of OpenTTDLab and its user-facing interface. I knew Python well, a savegame parser for OpenTTD was available in Python \cite{Stout2024} that the project forked from, programs written in Python are mostly platform independant, and anecdotally it's a popular language in data science and data analysis. To make sure OpenTTDLab did not depend on specific behaviour of a single Python version, which could impede repeatability and replicability of experiments, I made sure that the tests I wrote ran on multiple versions of Python.

OpenTTDLab automatically downloads OpenTTD, OpenGFx, and AIs. This was a direct consequence of running 

It also supports using AIs on the local filesystem. When replicating experiments that use AIs, when the experimenters do not directly use the code of the original researchers, I suspect a fast feedback is needed when writing code and running experiments using that code. While downloading AIs supports replicating experiments using published AI code, reproducing experiments would not us the AI code, and would use code on the local file system.

On the request of one of the maintainers of OpenTTD, OpenTTDLab caches OpenTTD, OpenGFX, and the AIs that it downloads....

I know from experience that there can be problems when a program written on one platform is used on another. While Python is meant to be platform independent, and OpenTTD runs on Linux, Windows and macOS, I discovered that not only are the OpenTTD binaries different for each platform, but also the processes of downloading, installing, and starting OpenTTD are different. So I made sure that OpenTTDLab detects the platform, and performs the appropriate steps for that platform, without the experimenter being concerned, so any Python code using OpenTTDLab written on one platform should run on another unchanged and behave identically. The tests run identically on each of these platforms, and so gives evidence of this property of OpenTTDLab.

From running OpenTTDLab, and being frustrated by run times, I decided to make OpenTTDLab run its experiments in parallel, by running multiple threads, and from each of these threads triggering OpenTTD configured appropriately for that experiment. The scaling results of these are shown in Section ...

\section{Rejected features}

I considered a number of features while creating OpenTTD - due to the high number of cycles of the design process, there are too many to recall or recount. However, there are three that I think are particularly relevant.

Firstly was the saving of results of experiments to a file, rather than to an ephemeral data structure in memory. If done well, I suspected this would have been a valuable feature: it could have aided analysis, made it easier to... . However.... SQLite, the most popular database in the world REF, also recommended by the US Library of Congress, would be an obvious candidate. But even after this choice, how to convert OpenTTDLab's arbitrary nested file structure into a relational model to be stored in a SQLite file is not obvious. Due to the relative permanency of any choice, in that once created, the files should be able to be interpreted in the long term, this should be done after examples of OpenTTDLab have been created.

Secondly, I considered some sort "verification" step built into the API - starting with v0.0.2 and removed in XXX, with at the time a vague notion of it being used in reproducing or replicating experiments. However, I found even the skeleton of this made generating the results of Chapter 4 awkward, or in more formal terms it and it seemed so far removed from what I knew of similar APIs.

Finally, I considered a file format for the configuration. This was rejected for essentially a combination of the previous two reasons - any file format must be carefully designed, and it seemed to make things awkward rather than easier.

Custom build of OpenTTD?? Local file?

Versions of these features could well be added in future versions, but ideally in a way that does not make repeating experiments such as those in Chapter 4 significantly more awkward and so negatively affecting the repeatabilty of experiments using OpenTTDLab, and so, given that repeating experiments is part of reproducing and replicating them, in a way that also doesn't make these activities more difficult.

Hmmm... is this being shoehorned in?? I guess I think it's important... can I argue that? Why is it important in terms of the 3Rs.


\chapter{Example results}

To get evidence of OpenTTD's usefulness in terms of repeatable, reproducible and replicable experiments, I used OpenTTD in 3 different situations. Firstly, to perform a more in-depth analysis of 2 existing OpenTTD AIs than seems to have been performed already, even by their authors. Secondly, to explore how a single parameter can change how a new simple AI performs, and shows that OpenTTDLab can be used to explore risk-benefit trade offs in basic supply chains. And finally to show how OpenTTDLab can be used to programmatically optimize this parameter using a basic algorithm.

\section{Analysis of existing OpenTTD AIs}

...

\section{Simple parameterised OpenTTD AI}

From the previous section, OpenTTDLab makes it straightforward to compare existing AIs, and its richness of output allows informed speculation as to the reasons for their behaviour differences. However, this doesn't by itself allow for a more detailed analysis of the behaviour of supply chains. OpenTTDLab's feature of running experiments over a range of configuration parameters passed to an AI allows for this.

So I constructed a simple parameterised AI. At runtime, the AI chooses the 2 largest towns, find a route between them, builds a road over this route, a depot and station at each end, and builds a configurable number of buses that carry between the two stations. The algorithm in more detail can be seen in Algorithm \ref{algorithm:simpleai}, with the core Squirrel code of the AI in Appendix X, with the Python code to run the experiments in Appendix Y.

The number of buses varied between 1 and 16, and each run was for 50 years, with 50 runs for each configuration covering random number generator seeds between and 1 and 50 inclusive.

\subsection{Results}

As can be seen in Figure XX, by the end of the 50 years, there appears to be a clear winner - on average the runs with 16 buses have more money in the bank than the others. It can be seen that early in the game, on average the configurations with 16 buses had the lowest amount of money, suggesting that in this very simplified situation, and with the caveat that the economic model of OpenTTD has been argued to be unrealistic REF, it seems to be the case that \emph{you have to spend money to make money}.

However, the situation is more complex. When taking into account the distributions, for example in, it's clear that while on average 16 buses are better, there is also greater risk with 16 buses than with the one - there is a higher chance of losing more money than with a single bus.

There is also an interesting convergence point around 1978: all configurations on average have on average the same amount of money in the bank. At the moment the reason for this convergence point is so far unexplained. As can be seen in Figure X, this convergence it is certainly not true that every run of the game makes the same amount of money - the distributions of money for 1 and 16 buses remains wide.

\section{Programmatically optimising AI parameter}

The framework has been used to extract how the bank balance from OpenTTD change over time for a company controlled by the TrainAI as in \label{fig:value-over-time}. The 

\begin{itemize}
  \item This has been created using a non-modified version of OpenTTD 13.1.
  \item The exact random seeds are shown
  \item There are 50 experiments run
  \item Each is run for the same amount of in game time
\end{itemize}

The output of the seeds used, all settings, OpenTTD version, without modification, should make the experiments repeatable, reproducible, and ideally replicable. Thus it is an improvement in these terms over many of the results reviewed in section 4.

A limitation of the framework is that the AI version used doesn't seem to have a version.

Bit of a "story" - starts off 300k. Then after a time there is a bi-modal distribution on money, then all the companies have have money in a normal-ish distribution.

Looks like the one with more stations/routes has more money? Can we corrolate stations with money?

\chapter{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\begin{item}
Maybe mention the link between this and testing here? Or should it be earlier?
\end{item}
\end{itemize}

The framework presented here allows experiments to be conducted with OpenTTD in a manner that is repeatable and reproducible. Reproducibility is up to the author's descriptions of the artefacts they created - they must be sufficient to recreate the artefacts, and so beyond the scope of the framework here. However, it should at least ease issues due to creating a similar enough experimental setup.

The exception are the version of the AI used - these do not appear to be versioned. However, potentially it could report on some sort of hash of the code of the AI.

Loads of further work. Two camps: developing OpenTTDLab reproducible: version stuff, action, file format to save for example? Parallelise, easier optimisation. User research as per EXAMPLE. But then using OpenTTDLab as well! Hopefully the results chapter will show it can be used to analyse existing AIs, develop new AIs in order to explore specific concepts, which in this case is risk/benefit trade off, and also exploring ways of optimising, er, something.

\cite{cimellaro2016computational} - it lists OpenTTD alongside "real" simulators of cities in discussion for disaster reliance, with no particular mention that's it a game/for entertainment??

Repeatability


\begin{itemize}
\begin{item}
\cite{dalle2012reproducibility} in simulation in particular "many published works based on simulation still fail to meet the minimum conditions to ensure reproducibility" (and in my opinion the OpenTTD ones are no exception). And it gives some "levels" L1, L2, L3, L4 on how to judge "how" reproducbiel simulations are and highlights specific desirable details about simulations. I can probably judge some existing research using this, and compare to maybe output using my OpenTTDLab thing?

Hidden details that prevent reproducilibty (it cites another source for this)

I quite like this one! (TODO Check things that cite it especially)

"Goes beyond" reproducibility into traceability...

"– a simulator refers to a reusable simulation engine and its Application Programming Interface
(API); the engine is reusable for the simulation of many models and scenarios;" OpenTTDLab I think is the "missing" simulator??

"In simulation, not only the same sources of error
exist, but the system itself can be modeled incorrectly and be a source of error"

"Furthermore, as will be explained in greater details
in the next section, simulation has many applications that are not aimed toward producing science
and, therefore, do not necessarily require a reproducibility based on the source code availability."

"• manipulation errors: These errors result from the manual handling of some of the tasks in the simulation study work-flow."

OpenTTDLab I think addresses loads of the issues mentioned, in many of the ways it suggests.
\end{item}


\begin{item}
\cite{monks2019strengthening} - Checklist style "STRESS" guidelines. Strengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies

It also has a review of lots of other guidelines for reproducible simulations

TODO: if going this way, reflect on the bits that OpenTTDLab does not do

"Agent-Based Simulation (ABS), Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) and System Dynamics (SD)." - er... OpenTTD is which of these??

"it is critical that author report the software version and build numbers" - this is for commercial software, but I would argue for Open Source as well
\end{item}

\begin{item}
Gass (1984) provides the earliest example of reporting guidelines for “computer based models”.
