    \begin{abstract}
        OpenTTD is an open source real time strategy (RTS) business simulation game based on the 1994 game Transport Tycoon Deluxe. In spite of being designed as a recreational game, OpenTTD has been the focus of a number of academic studies. However, these studies have problems regarding the reproducibility of their experiments. This paper summarises the problems, and suggests extensions to OpenTTD to avoid these problems in future.
