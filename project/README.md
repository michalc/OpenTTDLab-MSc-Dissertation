# Project materials

This archive contains the project materials for the MSc dissertation "OpenTTDLab: A reusable Python framework for repeatable, replicable, & reproducible experiments using OpenTTD"

- Notebooks/

   Python Jupyter notebooks used to generate, process, and visualise the results of the 3 experimental chapters contained in the dissertation, and the CSV files that contain processed results that were subsequently plotted within the dissertation itself.com

   They should each be self-contained, installing dependencies from the internet as needed. Each of the 3 experimental chapters has 2 notebooks: one to run the experiments and save the results in a raw format, and one to process and analyse the results, saving the output in a form suitable for visualisations in the dissertation itself.

- OpenTTDLab/

    A cloned copy of https://github.com/michalc/OpenTTDLab, the main output of the project. The notebooks do not require this: they install their own depenedencies, including OpenTTDLab, from the internet.

- ParameterisedAI/

    A cloned copy of https://github.com/michalc/ParameterisedAI/, the AI developed and used in the "Experiments 3: Scaling" chapter of the dissertation. The notebooks do not require this :they install their own depenedencies, including ParameterisedAI, from the internet.
